This repository is used to support and comment issues of AccessViewer

Access Database Viewer is a modern Microsoft Access database app.

It is the easy way to handle either the older MDB or the newer ACCDB file formats on your mac.

- View and export your data
- Supports Access database formats from 1997 to 2013

Access Database Viewer displays all your stored data but it can not modify databases and can not show forms or queries.

# Crash Reports

If you notice any crashes or bugs, please let me know about it. 
It would be a lot easier to fix crashes and bugs in the app if the specified files are present on the developers computer.

It helps a lot if you could manage to send the files (WITHOUT PRIVATE DATA) and a short explenation of the problem to the following mail address.
